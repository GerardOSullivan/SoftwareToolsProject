# Introduction
The DVD Kiosk System will be a fully fledged system that will allow users to sign up to the system and then rent DVDs. 

The objective of this will be to provide an MVP in a two week sprint after creating user stories relevant to the project/epic. 

The first sprint will be dedicated to getting a landing page up and running with database access and basic functionality.

# Getting Started
The main targets for the first sprint are:
1.	Create a landing page that will show DVDs that are already in the database - pulling cover images from an Azure Storage Blob.
2.	Add a search bar that will dynamically search the database as a user enters in their request - showing a relevant movie if possible.
3.	Add a section on the home page that will show the Top 5 movies (organised by times rented)
